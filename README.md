The objective of this analysis is to provide insights into an individual's financial habits, including income, expenses, savings, and investments. By understanding these key areas, the analysis aims to identify trends, optimize budget allocation, and offer personalized financial advice for improved financial health.

## Data Source
- **Power BI Report**: This .pbix file includes personal finance data with metrics related to income, spending patterns, savings, and investments. Data could be sourced from personal financial tracking systems or manually input records.

## Tools
- **Power BI**: Used for data transformation, visualization, and detailed analysis of financial metrics.
- **Excel (optional)**: Used for initial data entry and data cleanup if necessary.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
Data preparation steps included:
- **Data Categorization**: Standardized categories for income (e.g., salary, investments) and expenses (e.g., housing, food, entertainment).
- **Handling Missing Data**: Managed any missing values in key fields (e.g., transaction amounts, dates).
- **Date Formatting**: Ensured date fields are consistent to accurately track monthly or yearly trends.
- **Data Validation**: Checked for any duplicate or erroneous entries in transaction data to maintain data integrity.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Key questions explored in the analysis:
1. **Income Trends**: How does income vary month-to-month? What are the primary sources of income?
2. **Expense Breakdown**: What are the main categories of expenses, and how much is allocated to each category?
3. **Savings and Investments**: What percentage of income is saved or invested? What are the growth trends in savings?
4. **Budget Allocation**: Are there areas where spending exceeds recommended budget limits?
5. **Debt Analysis**: What is the level of debt and how is it changing over time?

## Results
1. **Income Insights**: Detailed monthly and yearly income trends, with insights into primary income sources.
2. **Spending Patterns**: Breakdown of spending across categories, identifying high-expenditure areas and potential for budget adjustments.
3. **Savings Growth**: Observed trends in savings contributions and recommendations to increase savings rates.
4. **Investment Performance**: Analysis of investment returns, highlighting the contribution of investments to overall financial health.
5. **Debt and Liability Trends**: Analysis of debt, including monthly repayments and the effect on overall net worth.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following steps are recommended:
- **Increase Savings Rate**: Set aside a higher percentage of income for savings, especially during months with lower expenses.
- **Optimize Spending on Non-Essentials**: Reduce spending in categories like entertainment and dining out, if they exceed budget limits.
- **Regularly Monitor Investments**: Assess investment performance periodically to ensure alignment with financial goals.
- **Plan for Debt Reduction**: Develop a structured plan to reduce debt, prioritizing high-interest loans for repayment.

## Limitations
- **Data Consistency**: The analysis may be limited by inconsistencies or missing data in the transaction history.
- **Limited Timeframe**: A longer timeframe would provide a more comprehensive understanding of financial habits and trends.
- **Lack of External Factors**: Excluding factors like inflation or economic shifts might affect the accuracy of financial recommendations.
